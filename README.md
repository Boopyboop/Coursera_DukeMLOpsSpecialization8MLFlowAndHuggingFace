## What I'm Exploring

This course covers two of the most popular open-source platforms for MLOps: **MLflow** and **Hugging Face**. Over four modules, I'll explore:

* Experiment tracking, run/model/artifact management with MLflow
* Working with Hugging Face: repositories, datasets, models, and APIs
* Deploying Hugging Face models with containerization, FastAPI, and cloud platforms
* Fine-tuning models, exporting to formats like ONNX, and deploying in spaces / cloud environments

Each module will have **its own folder**, containing:

* A `README.md` explaining the module’s goals and what I worked on
* A `requirements.txt` with dependencies for that module
* Script(s), notebooks, configuration files relevant to that module

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mlops-mlflow-huggingface-duke.git
cd mlops-mlflow-huggingface-duke
```

### 2. Navigate to a Module Folder

For example, Module 1:

```bash
cd module-1_introduction_to_mlflow
```

### 3. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 4. Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
